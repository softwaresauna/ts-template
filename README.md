# Typescript Template

This is a template project, meaning it is created to be copied or forked to serve as a base for other software.

It comes equipped with:

- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- a sensible `.gitignore`
- a couple of dummy (Typescript) source files to demonstrate it works and is testable
- [Typescript configuration](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) configured with some opinion (and not to conflict with Prettier)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
  
## Usage

Take the files and use them to start your own Javascript project.

### Using Yarn

- gather dependencies: `yarn`
- build: `yarn build`
- test: `yarn test`
- start: `yarn start`
